stable as of `1.0.0`; only patch-level defect fixes will be accepted against
these contracts going forward. Install with

{doc}`v1.0.0 upgrade checklist <upgrade/v1.0.0-upgrade-checklist>`, the

:class: tip

[Open the interactive web demo](https://calibrated-explanations-demo.ju.se/)
to explore a guided workflow or use the expert interface without installing the
package locally.

The demo is illustrative. Use this versioned documentation as the authority for
supported APIs, behavior, assumptions, and guarantees.
```

- New users start in {doc}`get-started/index`.
- Practitioners use {doc}`practitioner/index`.
- Researchers use {doc}`researcher/index`.
- Contributors use {doc}`contributor/index`.

Semantics are mode-specific. Classification, interval regression, and
probabilistic regression do not share one guarantee statement. For semantics,
assumptions, and non-guarantees, use
{doc}`foundations/concepts/calibrated_interval_semantics`.

## Companion projects

Use {doc}`plugins` to find optional companion extensions and
{doc}`researcher/replication/index` to reproduce published studies with their
version-specific environments.
